# Extreme invaders: data and scripts

This is the companion repository for the article:<br><br>
<big><b>Baquero R.A., Barbosa A.M., Ayllón D., Guerra C., Sánchez E., Araújo M.B. & Nicola G.G. (under review) <i>Potential distributions of invasive vertebrates in the Iberian Peninsula under projected changes in extreme climate events<7i></b>.</big>
<br><br>

The repository contains:
- the values of the regional climatic extreme <b>variables</b> computed by members of the team;
- the redistributable parts of the <b>species occurrence data</b>, namely those currently available on GBIF or published in data papers;
- the <b>R scripts</b> which reproduce our complete analysis and resulting plots. The results won't be exactly the same, as in the article we used additional data on species occurrence which should be obtained directly from their authors or holding institutions.

A link to the article itself will be provided here when it is published.
