# Extreme invaders data and scripts

This is the accompanying repository for <b>Baquero RA, Barbosa AM, Ayllón D, Guerra C, Sánchez E, Araújo MB & Nicola GG "<i>Potential distributions of invasive vertebrates in the Iberian Peninsula under projected changes in extreme climate events</i>"</b>, currently under review in Diversity & Distributions.

The repository contains the values of the regional climatic extreme <b>variables</b> computed by the team; the redistributable parts of the <b>species occurrence data</b>, namely those currently available on GBIF or published in data papers; and the <b>R scripts</b> which reproduce our complete analysis. The results won't be exactly the same, as in our paper we used additional data on species occurrence which should be obtained directly from their authors or holding institutions.
