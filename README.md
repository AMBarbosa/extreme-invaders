This is the accompanying repository for <b>Baquero, Barbosa, Ayllón, Guerra, Sánchez, Araújo & Nicola "<i>Potential distributions of invasive vertebrates in the Iberian Peninsula under projected changes in extreme climate events</i>"</b>, currently under review in Diversity & Distributions.

The repository contains the regional climatic extreme <b>variables</b>, the redistributable parts of the <b>species occurrence data</b>, and the <b>R scripts</b> necessary to reproduce our complete analysis. The results won't be exactly the same, though, as in the paper we used additional species occurrence data that should be obtained directly from their authors or holding institutions.
